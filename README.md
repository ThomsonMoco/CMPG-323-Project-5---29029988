# CMPG-323-Project-5---29029988

This project required the extensive usagee of Power BI and it was used to create the report which includes visualization and summary objects.

Upon opening, the user is met by the High-Level Monitoring page which is the first of 3 pages. On this page, I utilized my own ideas of important information that had to be displayed including devices added per quarter per year and the number of totoal devices displayed in terms of whether they are Active or not.

The second page is the Device Monitoring which displays the different vizualizations regarding Device items and their relationships with other entities.

The last page is the Device Registration page which is related to the Date of installation for devices and categories. This page displays a time related visualizatio and timelien feature which displays when certain devices were added to the system.

Filters have also been applied on the entire report and certain pages as well as data cleaning in the beginning of the project
